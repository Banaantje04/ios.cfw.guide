Take caution with updating to iOS 14.0 - 14.2 as checkra1n only supports A9(X) and A10(X) devices at this time.
{: .notice--danger }

## Required Reading

If you're on an unsupported firmware version, you can update to {% include latestfw %} and use the checkra1n jailbreak instead if your device is compatible.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest version for these devices is {% include latestfw %}, we can easily update to the desired firmware version.

If you have installed update blocking via tvOS Beta profiles, you must first remove that profile before updating. If you don't know what this means, ignore this.

## Removing Profiles

Only follow this if you've installed update blocking in the past.
