## Required Reading

Semi-untethered jailbreaks require the use of a sideloaded app to jailbreak. Apps sideloaded with a regular AppleID will expire after 7 days. After that period, you will no longer be able to open that app to re-jailbreak.

AltDaemon allows AltStore to automatically re-sign these applications, without needing to connect to a computer running AltServer over local network.

You must have AltStore v1.4 or later to use AltDaemon.
