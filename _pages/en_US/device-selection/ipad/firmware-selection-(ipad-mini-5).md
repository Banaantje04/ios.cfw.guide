## Required Reading

Different firmware versions will require different steps to jailbreak your iOS device. This page will help you find where to start.

Select the appropriate page for your version from the chart below. Note that the "from" and "to" fields are inclusive. This means that, for example, the "from 13.0 to {% include latestfw %}" row includes version 13.0, version {% include latestfw %}, and all versions in-between.

Your device version can be found in the Settings application in `General` -> `About`.

There is no jailbreak on firmwares 12.4.1 and above for this device.

unc0ver is also compatible with firmware versions 12.0 to 12.4 (excluding firmwares 12.3 and 12.3.1) however we recommend use Chimera instead due to it being easier to use.
{: .notice--primary}

In boxes marked `--`, there is no jailbreak for that firmware version.
