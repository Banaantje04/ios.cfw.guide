JailbreakMe Star is capable of jailbreaking every device on iPhone OS 3.1.2 to iOS 4.0.1

JailbreakMe Star is an untethered jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or Future Restore

## Running JailbreakMe Saffron

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [jailbreakme.com](https://jailbreakme.com) website
1. Slide to the right on "Slide to Jailbreak"

After a couple of minutes, Cydia should be installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install [tweaks](faq#tweaks), themes and more.
