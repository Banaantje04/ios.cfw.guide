You should now be jailbroken with Sileo installed on your home screen. You can use Sileo to install [tweaks](faq#tweaks), themes, packages and more.

Before you can start installing anything else, you first need to install a few necessary programs.

## Installing packages

1. Open the newly installed Sileo application
1. Go to the "Packages" tab
1. Select the filter button next to "Name", then select "Developer"
1. Tap "Upgrade All" if there are any updates
- Do not install yet
1. Go to the "Search" tab
1. Search for the "libhooker" and "libhooker configurator" packages
1. Tap the "Get" button for both
1. Tap on the "Queued" bar at the bottom of your screen
1. Tap "Confirm"
1. Once your device finishes respringing, open the libhooker configurator app
1. Check that tweaks switch is enabled
   - If not, turn it on and follow the prompts to userspace reboot
   - If it is, you're done
