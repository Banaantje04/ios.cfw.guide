Coolbooter allows you to dualboot any supported version of iOS on a select few of iOS device. Coolbooter is permanent, but can be removed through the Coolbooter app on the main OS.

This guide will require that you are already jailbroken on a supported OS listed above.

## Installing Coolbooter

1. Add the repo: <code><a href="https://coolbooter.com/" target="_blank">https://coolbooter.com/</a></code> using Cydia
1. Download and install Coolbooter
1. Tap `Install`
    - Choose any version of iOS you'd like
    - You can choose how much storage the new partition is allocated by tapping `Storage`
1. Once your Coolbooter configuration is to your liking, tap `I'm Ready`
1. Follow all onscreen prompts
    - We recommend you choose to jailbreak the new OS as Coolbooter-installed versions of iOS cannot be jailbroken except by Coolbooter itself

    - You will need to jailbreak again if you are using a semi-untethered jailbreak
1. Open Coolbooter
