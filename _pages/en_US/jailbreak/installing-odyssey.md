Odyssey is a [semi-untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak#semi-untethered-jailbreaks){:target="_blank"}, meaning it requires a app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot. Click the link to learn more.
{:.notice--info}

iPhone 7 &#124; 7 Plus devices on iOS 13.5.1 - 13.7 may experience reliability issues with Odyssey. We recommend using [checkra1n](/checkra1n)
{: .notice--info}

If you are already jailbroken with unc0ver, make sure to properly [remove it](removing-u0)

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be [re-signed](resigning-apps) once every 7 days.

We will use AltStore to install the Odyssey jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.
