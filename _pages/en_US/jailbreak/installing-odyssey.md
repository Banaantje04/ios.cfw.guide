This jailbreak is compatible with A8(X) &amp A9(X) devices from 13.0 - 13.5 and all other iOS devices from 13.0 to 13.7.

Odyssey is a [semi-untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak#semi-untethered-jailbreaks){:target="_blank"}, meaning it requires a app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot. Click the link to learn more.
{:.notice--info}

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be [re-signed](resigning-apps) once every 7 days.

We will use AltStore to install the Odyssey jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.
