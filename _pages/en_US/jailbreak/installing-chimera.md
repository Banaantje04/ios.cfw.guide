If you have a newer device with an A12 processor, such as the iPhone XS, you can only use Chimera on firmware versions 12.0 to 12.1.2.

Chimera is a [semi-untethered jailbreak](/types-of-jailbreak#semi-untethered-jailbreaks){:target="_blank"}, meaning it requires a app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot. Click the link to learn more.
{:.notice--info}

Chimera is capable of jailbreaking nearly every iOS device on firmware version 12.0 up to 12.4, excluding 12.3 and 12.3.1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be [re-signed](resigning-apps) once every 7 days.

We will use AltStore to install the Chimera jailbreak application to your iOS device for use in the next step.
