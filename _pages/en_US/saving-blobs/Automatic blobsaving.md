## Saving blobs automatically
1. Search for and download "shshd"
2. Done! now blobs will automatically be saved when you download shshd, every time you rejailbreak, and every week after that. The blobs are available at the [TSS saver website](https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/), in order to retrieve them, go to "retrieve" and put in your ECID

## Running shshd manually
If you ever want to run shshd manually, here is how:
1. SSH into the device or Download NewTerm 2
2. Type ```sudo /usr/sbin/shshd``` (if it asks for a password and you haven't changed it, type alpine)
3. It should say "Link to blobs: https://tsssaver.1conan.com/shsh/" then the device's ECID.
Done! If you encounter any issues, join and ask for support in the [r/jailbreak Discord server](https://discord.gg/gKAHPtwcGd)
