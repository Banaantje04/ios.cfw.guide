2. Done! now blobs will automatically be saved when you download shshd and every sunday. The blobs are available at the [TSS saver website](https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/), in order to retrieve them, go to "retrieve" and put in your ECID

## Running shshd manually
if youve ever wanted to run shshd manually, here is how:
1. SSH into the device or Download NewTerm 2
2. Type ```sudo /usr/sbin/shshd``` (if it asks for a password and you haven't changed it, type alpine)
3. It should say "Link to blobs: https://tsssaver.1conan.com/shsh/" then the devices ECID.
